# Learn From OpenSource Code
This project is just a playground for learning web technologies like React, Redux and Webpack.

I am aware of the fact this feature this can be achieved with [GitHub](www.github.com) itself and of the fact that I am reinventing the wheel, but my purpose is to learn.

## Things I experimented

- app structure
- write ES6 code
- implement client-side routing
- organise the style in multiple SCSS files
- work with React and Redux concepts
- debounce multiple function calls
- work with SemanticUI
- write tests using Mocha, Enzyme and Chai
